# adscribeAI-python-secure
This Python application uses the OpenAI API to generate product descriptions. This repository is part of a university research project evaluating secure coding practices. This version has been refactored to implement security best practices, loading the OpenAI API key from environment variables using the python-dotenv library instead of hardcoding it.
